Markdown is a lightweight markup language created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz that strives for maximum readability and ease of publishing in both input and output forms, drawing inspiration from many existing conventions for marking up email messages using plain text. It is distributed under a BSD license and is distributed as a plugin (or at least available) in various content management systems (CMS).
